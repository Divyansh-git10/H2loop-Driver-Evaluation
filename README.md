# 🛠️ Linux Driver Evaluation System

This project implements an **automated evaluation pipeline** for Linux character device driver code — including code generated by LLMs.  
The system scores each driver file on:

- ✅ Compilation success  
- ✅ Style compliance  
- ✅ Security heuristics  

It outputs a **detailed JSON report** with component-wise scores.

---

## 📌 Features

- ⚙️ Compilation check using `gcc`
- 🎯 Style compliance via `checkpatch.pl` (Linux kernel style)
- 🔐 Security scan for:
  - Buffer overflows
  - Race condition indicators
  - Input validation issues
- 🤖 LLM-generated driver evaluation
- 🧮 Score calculation based on weighted metrics
- 🧪 Bonus: Runtime test simulation
- 💡 LLM fine-tuning suggestions

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Upload your `.c` driver file in Colab (e.g., `char_driver_sample.c`)
2. Run each cell in `h2loop.ipynb`:
   - `compile_driver()`
   - `check_style()`  
   - `run_security_checks()`  
   - `calculate_score()`

3. Final output:  
   📄 `evaluation_result.json`  
   Includes compilation, style, and security scores with total

---

## 🧪 Test Files Included

- `char_driver_sample.c` — base test driver  
- `llm_generated_driver.c` — ChatGPT-generated driver  
- `test_driver_sim.c` — simulates runtime test

---

## 📊 Sample Output

```json
{
  "compilation": {"success": false, "warnings": 0, "errors": 1},
  "code_quality": {"style_score": 1.0},
  "security": {
    "buffer_safety": 1.0,
    "race_conditions": 0.5,
    "input_validation": 0.4
  },
  "overall_score": 35.83
}

## 🧠 Bonus Tasks

### 1. Simulated Runtime Test

A user-space simulation (`test_driver_sim.c`) mimics interaction with the driver (read/write buffer).
➡️ Output saved in `results/runtime_test_output.txt`

### 2. LLM Evaluation Suggestions

See: `LLM_Suggestions` file for notes on fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and evaluation loop design.
